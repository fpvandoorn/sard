/-- **Sard's theorem**. Let $M$ and $N$ be real $C^r$ manifolds of dimensions
$m$ and $n$, and $f:M→N$ a $C^r$ map. If $r>\max{0, m-n}$,
the set of regular values of $f$ has full measure.

Note that mathlib already contains a weaker version of Sard's theorem,
as `addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_det_fderivWithin_eq_zero` in the file `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Function.Jacobian.Manifold`.
This local result implies the case $m=n$ for $r\geq 1$ (not hard to show).
However, note that the case $m > n$ requires a different proof: for $m>n$, the condition
$f\in C^1$ is not sufficient any more: Whitney (1957) constructed a C¹ function
$$f : ℝ² → ℝ$$ whose set of critical values contains an open set, thus has positive measure. -/
